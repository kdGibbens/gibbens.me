        A decade ago I decided to change directions in my life and I began
        learning to code. Flash forward to today and I have worked for a variety
        of companies big and small including Toms of Maine, Hills Petfood, NWEA,
        Cloudbolt Software and Drivewy.com. I take pride in my attention to
        detail and my drive to succeed in all my projects.

        Some areas of interest I have is developing designs, and animation.
        Recently I have been branching on my own into the backend learning
        Node.js and GraphQL.

        When I am not working/coding and learning I enjoy the simple things in
        life like KU basketball. I am loving cat dad to the Archduke Franz
        Furdinand and avid bedroom guitarist, bassist, and more recently
        synthesizers. I currently live in the Portland Metro and enjoy the life
        out on the west coast.
